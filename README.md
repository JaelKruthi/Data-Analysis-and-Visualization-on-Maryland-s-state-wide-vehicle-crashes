# Data-Analysis-and-Visualization-on-Maryland-s-state-wide-vehicle-crashes
The objective of this project is to view the crashes that occurred in the given timeframe in different countyâ€™s and different conditions which were responsible in causing the crashes by visualizing and performing exploratory data analysis to the already existing data.

# Business Case: 
This project analyzes vehicle crash data from Maryland (2015-2021) to identify key trends and factors contributing to accidents, with a focus on understanding the role of demographic, environmental, and temporal factors in shaping accident patterns.

# Goal: 
The primary goal of this analysis is to provide actionable insights on accident patterns, seasonality, and contributing factors like weather conditions, road conditions, and vehicle types. These insights aim to inform local authorities, insurers, and policymakers in improving road safety and planning targeted interventions.

# Deliverables: 
The repository includes all the necessary code for:

Data cleaning: Handling missing values, outliers, and irrelevant data.
Data merging: Combining multiple data sources (e.g., accident details, weather conditions, vehicle types).
Data visualization: Generating clear visualizations for trends and distributions.
Statistical analysis: Conducting hypothesis tests and assessing significant patterns.
Trend analysis: Identifying accident patterns based on location, demographics, weather, and time.

# Results & Evaluation: 
Average Age of Drivers by County
Gender-Based Accident Distribution
Seasonal & Temporal Patterns in Accidents
Z-test on Age and Accident Frequency
Histogram of Data Distributions: A series of histograms were generated for various numerical columns, providing insights into the distributions of key variables (e.g., age, accident severity, vehicle types).
This helped identify outliers and common patterns in the accident data (e.g., most drivers involved in accidents tend to be within certain age ranges).

# Business Impact: 
The analysis offers valuable insights for multiple stakeholders:

Local Authorities: By identifying accident-prone areas, times, and factors (such as weather or road conditions), authorities can allocate resources more effectively to improve road safety.

Insurance Companies: Insurers can use the insights to adjust premium rates based on high-risk factors, like certain vehicle types or weather conditions.

Policymakers: The insights on age demographics, weather conditions, and accident frequency can guide the implementation of targeted interventions, such as public awareness campaigns or infrastructure improvements.

# Next Steps: 
Using machine learning techniques to predict accident hotspots based on time of day, weather conditions, and historical accident data. This would help authorities proactively deploy resources and interventions.

Further segmenting driver behaviors and crash causes (e.g., speeding, distracted driving) could provide more granular insights for developing targeted safety campaigns.
